# IPGEN — IP adress generator

## Description
This program generates fake IP adresses, that can be stored in a file, or just be printed in the command line.
Use the best option for your operative system, Windows or Unix.

## Usage
```
ipgen [num] [-s]
```

`[num]`: number of IPs that you want to generate.

`[-s]`: Use this flag only if you want to store the generated IP addresses in a file. The resulting
adresses are stored inside `'logs/ip.log'`.
